### Practice programming exos in delightful Learning eXperience

**The traditionnal way of practicing with programming exercises is full of friction making the whole process a painful experience!**

<!-- If you are a student:
# 1. Are you tired of entering values in the terminal manually to fill the requested values ?
# 1. Are you tired of finding errors in your code days later in your labs or in your exo code because there is no automated test and you didn't test it manually for the edge cases ?
#
# Instead of spending mental time on taking care of boilerplate code creation, compilation, execution, output comparison, solution comparison, ... What if **deliberate practice** could inspire a much faster feedback loop and increase the focus on writing code by automating all the steps around ?
