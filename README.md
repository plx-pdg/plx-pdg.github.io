## Why
> The classic way of doing programming exercises is full of friction that slows down the progress, and creates distraction from learning. PLX is here to build a redefine the experience, based on deliberate practice principles, because IT students really deserve it.

#### Practice programming exos in delightful Learning eXperience

Whether you are learning C, C++ or Java, PLX can bring you
1. üîÅ **A feedback loop as short as possible**  
The compilation and checks run immediately after file changes, removing the time to click the Play button or finding the build command and target file.
1. üíØ **100% focus on the learning tasks**  
Writing code, fixing compilation errors, making checks pass and refactor. All other administrative steps are automated, reducing feedback time and removing some mental overhead !
1. ‚òÄÔ∏è **Rich check results and various type automated checks**  
Mentally comparing 20 lines of output with the expected output is a thing of the past! The output should already be diffed to highlight differences in colors.

## The classic experience
If you are not helped by any tool except your IDE (no existing file, no test, no runner, no watch mode), and your compile+run the exo manually in the terminal, here is the view of the workflow.

All steps (as bubbles) are necessary actions to be done manually by students, the blue ones are those that could be completely/partially automated. 

## The PLX experience
In the same context, running an exo with PLX looks like this: no more blue steps, faster process and almost zero friction!

Here we consider the *Compare output* step to not exist because PLX shows a nice words level diff of the output compared to the expected one, enabling instant understanding of the issue.

## Helping students
As you can imagine PLX can have a big impact on the speed of 

## Helping teachers
We don't have specific features for teachers right now, 
If you are teaching a course related to C, C++ or Java, PLX can help you maintain your exercises and easily add automated checks to verify the common and edge cases.
