## Logo design

In the spirit of Delibay and PRJS logos, a simple gradient was chosen on the project name. Like PRJS, the text is an ASCII art creation. It was generated with the help of [Calligraphy](https://calligraphy.geopjr.dev/) with the font `Blocky`. The gradient is composed of these 2 colors: `#fc1100`, `#ffb000` applied to this text piece.

It was colored in Inkscape with a monospace font (any monospace font should be okay) and exported in SVG:
